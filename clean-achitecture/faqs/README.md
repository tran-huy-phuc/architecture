**- Is Clean Architecture only for large projects?**
> No! Clean Architecture benefits both small and large projects, but its true power is seen in complex applications that grow over time.

---

**Is Clean Architecture the same as MVVM, MVP, or MVC?**
> No! Those are UI-layer patterns, while Clean Architecture covers the entire application structure, including business logic and data management.

---

**What are the drawbacks of Clean Architecture?**
> • More code at the start → Due to multiple layers.

> • Steep learning curve → Especially for beginners.

> • May seem over-engineered → For small projects.

**What are the differences between "Enterprise Business Rules" (Entities) and "Application Business Rules" (Use Cases)?**
| Feature | **Enterprise Business Rules (Entities)** | **Application Business Rules (Use Cases)** |
|---------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Core business rules that define domain models and concepts, independent of any specific application. | Application-specific logic that orchestrates how entities are used in workflows. |
| **Scope** | Broad, reusable across multiple applications. | Specific to a particular application’s workflows. |
| **Dependencies** | No external dependencies (e.g., APIs, databases, frameworks). | Can depend on **Entities**, but not on external frameworks or infrastructure. |
| **Change Frequency** | Changes **rarely**, as they represent fundamental business rules. | Changes **more frequently**, as they depend on specific application needs. |
| **Example 1: E-commerce App** | `Product` entity with `id`, `name`, `price`, `description`. | `CheckoutUseCase` that calculates total price, applies discounts, and processes payment. |
| **Example 2: Finance App** | `Transaction` entity with `amount`, `currency`, `date`, `type`. | `GenerateMonthlyReportUseCase` that aggregates transactions for reporting. |
