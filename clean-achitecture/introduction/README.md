## 1. What is Clean Architecture?

Clean Architecture, proposed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), is a software design pattern that organizes code into separate, independent layers. It focuses on **separation of concerns**, making the codebase **maintainable, scalable, and testable**.

## 2. The Layers of Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture follows a **layered, circular dependency rule: inner layers should not depend on outer layers**.

## üìå Core Layers (From Inner to Outer)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Entities (Enterprise Business Rules)**

‚Ä¢ Represents core business logic and domain models.

‚Ä¢ Independent of frameworks and databases.

‚Ä¢ Example: User, Order, Product classes in an e-commerce app.

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Use Cases (Application Business Rules)**

‚Ä¢ Contains application-specific logic.

‚Ä¢ Implements business rules using entities.

‚Ä¢ Calls repositories to retrieve or update data.

‚Ä¢ Example: ProcessPaymentUseCase, AuthenticateUserUseCase.

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Interface Adapters (Presentation & Data Layer)**

‚Ä¢ Adapts data between domain and external sources (UI, APIs, Databases).

‚Ä¢ Repositories act as an interface between use cases and data sources.

‚Ä¢ Example:

    + State Management (BloC, Provider, Riverpod, etc.)
    + Repositories (Data Fetching Layer)
    + DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for APIs

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Frameworks & Drivers (Infrastructure Layer)**

‚Ä¢ External systems like APIs, Databases, UI frameworks, Cloud Services.

‚Ä¢ Should be replaceable without affecting business logic.

‚Ä¢ Example:

    + Firebase, REST APIs, GraphQL
    + Flutter Widgets, HTTP clients, SQLite databases

## 3. Pros and Cons of Clean Architecture

‚úÖ Pros (Why Use It?)

    ‚úî Separation of Concerns: Makes the code modular and easier to maintain.

    ‚úî Testability: Business logic can be tested independently of UI and external services.

    ‚úî Scalability & Flexibility: Easy to replace UI frameworks, databases, or APIs without affecting core business logic.

    ‚úî Better Collaboration: Teams can work independently on different layers.

‚ùå Cons (Challenges & Criticism)

    ‚úî Over-Engineering: For small projects, it introduces unnecessary complexity.

    ‚úî Too Many Files: Simple tasks require multiple files (UseCase, Repository, DataSource, DTO, etc.).

    ‚úî Harder Onboarding: New developers may struggle to understand all the abstractions.

    ‚úî More Boilerplate Code: Requires extra code for layers and dependency injection.

## 4. When Should You Use Clean Architecture?

‚úÖ Recommended for:

	‚úî Large & complex applications (e.g., enterprise apps, e-commerce platforms).
	‚úî Long-term projects that require maintainability.
	‚úî Apps with multiple data sources and business logic rules.

‚ùå Not necessary for:

	‚úî Small apps with simple logic.
	‚úî Quick MVPs where speed is more important than structure.
